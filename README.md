# 🧠 Rubik’s Cube Solver – Layer-by-Layer Strategy (3x3)

This project simulates solving a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube using the **Layer-by-Layer (LBL)** method in Python. It is intended for educational, research, and prototype-building purposes.


## ✅ Features

- Solves the cube layer-by-layer (White Cross → First Layer Corners → Middle Edges → Yellow Cross → Final Layer).
- Supports standard cube moves: U, U’, D, D’, L, L’, R, R’, F, F’, B, B’.
- Modular Python structure with each function handling part of the cube logic.
- Allows scrambling with predefined or random sequences.
- Clean output showing cube state at each step.



## 📌 Uses

- To understand how Rubik’s Cube algorithms work.
- Practice and learn logical problem solving.
- Demonstrate layered solving techniques.
- Serve as a base model for AI-based cube solvers.
- Educational tool for students learning algorithmic thinking.



## 🌍 Applications

- **Educational Software** – Teach cube-solving steps in classes or coding workshops.
- **Robotics** – Control robotic arms to solve cubes using this algorithm.
- **Artificial Intelligence** – Build heuristic solvers or reinforcement learning models.
- **Gaming** – Integrate into puzzle-based games and simulators.
- **Visualization Tools** – Create GUI/web apps for cube solving.
- **Hackathons & Competitions** – Use as a logic-based project demo.



## 🛠️ Where to Implement

- Embedded Systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi-based cube solvers)
- Python-based simulation software
- Web applications using Python backend and JS/3D frontends
- Robotics kits for education (Lego Mindstorms, Arduino)
- Android/iOS educational apps for solving cubes
- Tech exhibitions or coding hackathons



## 🏁 Conclusion

This Rubik’s Cube solver demonstrates how complex problems can be solved step-by-step using logical layers. The Layer-by-Layer method is beginner-friendly, modular, and ideal for expanding into advanced solutions like AI, robotics, or visualization. It builds not only a cube solver but also strong programming and algorithmic thinking skills.
